## 2. Techniques and Tools
### 2.1 Communication among the Team

During the creation step of functions of the project, the team will communicate through a group chat to constantly update each other on functionality, clarity on instructions, specifications, and overall process of the project. And then, Github and pytest integration via Github Actions were used to ensure that any edits that any team member has made were integrated with the main project without flaws.

### 2.2 Communication with the Customer
With the customer, communication happens through either the customer's github page or Discord application in order to clarify any details of the project that may cause misunderstanding or ambiguity on the final desired product. Links to the pull requests made my development team members were occassionally sent to the customer so that the customer could check up on the process.

### 2.3 FrontEnd
We will be using Python language and Flask library in order to create the frontend.
