1. All the user input fields were covered, and there  was no successful exploit, as both times, the program ended with "[20:08:13] [ERROR] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable."

2. Second one, with cookie, the program was able to check if all the forms within the user account page that is only accessible after a login.

3.
