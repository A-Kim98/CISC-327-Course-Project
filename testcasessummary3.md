Describing the test plan:

 Q. How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases?
 A. We have decided to name our testcases testcases1, testcases2, etc.,. and then testcasessummary1, testcasessummary2, etc.,. and put them in the same place, where Neila was in charge of 1, Alice was in 2, I was in 3, and Bram was in 4.
 We had testcasesX files for detailed documentation of what steps each tests should go through in order to justify the requirements (or reject the requirements), and tescasessummaryX files lists what each test case does in natural language, so that clients or other programmers can easily understand what we are testing, thus approving that we are checking their standards.

 Q. Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub?
 A. The chosen testing framework will be tested using pytest library. It will be under the "action" tab of github, where the python application we put through will go through series of tests that we assigned via pytest library, which will be in a seperate test case codes to be uploaded in future assignments.
 It is possible to run the test cases locally on our computer, where we can test between codes to make sure that our codes are properly placed and that no wrong codes (codes that do not fit our customer's requirements or codes that simply do not function as programmer intended) are placed. However, whenever we upload to github and submit a pull request, github action will automatically make sure that the uploaded code meets the decided standards on the cloud, and approve the pull request if everything returned correct results, rejecting otherwise. Through this, without testing every single possible errors reviewers would be worried about, it will be easy to detect anything that went wrong during the last edit.

 Q. How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)
 A. We decided that, a seperate folder should store all test case code files, and each test case codes with same first value of test case ID will be grouped together (So all R1 will be in one folder, R2, etc.,.). This is so that, should test case codes be updated to meet new standards or such, it will be easy to identify what codes does what, according to the test cases summary files uploaded during this assignment.
